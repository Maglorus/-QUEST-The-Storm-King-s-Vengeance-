# -QUEST-The-Storm-King-s-Vengeance-
I logged in during the quest's fulfillment http://www.wowhead.com/quest=12919/the-storm-kings-vengeance when I was sitting on the giant Gymer. After logging in back, the "Gymer's Buddy" buff remained on my character, no NPCs are shown, only mobs from this quest. Logout and logon does not help and this bugg remains. Thank you in advance for solving my problem.
